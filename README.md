# 🧠 Companion Model for [jslok/card-scanner](https://github.com/jslok/card-scanner)

This repository provides a sample trained model meant to be used **in combination with** the excellent [`card-scanner`](https://github.com/jslok/card-scanner) project by [@jslok](https://github.com/jslok).

> ⚠️ All credit for the original scanner UI and runtime goes to **@jslok**.  
> This repository is not affiliated with the original project – it exists to help the community **experiment with a working model** compatible with `card-scanner`.

### 📈 What’s next?

If there's interest, I may release:
- The **full dataset generation script**
